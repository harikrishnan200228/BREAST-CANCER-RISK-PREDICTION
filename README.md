# BREAST-CANCER-RISK-PREDICTION
Project Title: [e.g., Breast Cancer Risk Prediction using Multi-Modal AI]
🧠 About
This project applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict breast cancer risk by integrating DATAS with clinical and genetic data. It combines traditional feature-based modeling with computer vision approaches to improve diagnostic accuracy and decision support in healthcare.

🔧 Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing

predicting datas

Integration of clinical/genetic data using ensemble models

Multi-modal feature fusion (early, late, and hybrid)

Model evaluation using accuracy, AUC, precision, recall

Streamlit web app for interactive prediction interface

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit

cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app/app.py
📈 Results
Achieved 92.5% AUC on the test set using multi-modal model combining image and structured data.

🧪 Future Work
Incorporate attention mechanisms for interpretability

Fine-tune on larger and more diverse datasets

Deploy as a full-stack web application
